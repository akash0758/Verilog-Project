# Verilog-Project

1. Implementing MUX based logic and JK synchronous counter:
a) Write a Verilog module to implement a 2-to-1 multiplexer (MUX) at (i) structural level using elementary two-input
logic gates (NOT, NAND, NOR), (ii) behavioural level. Using this module and other elementary two-input logic
gates as necessary, build a 2
n
-to-1 MUX that can implement any Boolean function of 5 variables.
b) Write a Verilog module to implement a clock-enabled JK flip-flop (Jack Kilby flip-flop) at (i) structural level using
elementary two-input logic gates (NOT, NAND, NOR), (ii) behavioural level. Using this module and other twoinput logic gates as necessary, build a four-bit synchronous binary counter.
